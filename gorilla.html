                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Gorillas are the largest primates, known for their strength and intelligence. 
                        They are social animals that live in groups called troops, led by a dominant silverback</p>
                    <p>
                        Gorillas are primarily herbivores, feeding on leaves, stems, and fruits. 
                        They have a complex social structure and communicate through vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions. 
                        Gorillas are critically endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.</p>
                    <p>
                        Gorillas are the largest living primates, with adult males weighing up to 180 kg (400 lbs) or more. 
                        They have broad chests, long arms, and thick black hair. Despite their powerful appearance, gorillas are generally gentle and shy animals.</p>
                    <p>
                        Gorillas are found in the forests of central and western Africa. 
                        They play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping to disperse seeds and maintain the health of their habitats. 
                        Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures and their habitats.</p>
