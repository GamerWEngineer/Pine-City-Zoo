                    <h3>TIGER</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are known for their distinctive orange coat with black stripes. 
                        They are native to Asia and are primarily found in forests, grasslands, and wetlands.</p>
                    <p>
                        Tigers are solitary hunters and are known for their strength and agility. They primarily prey on large ungulates such as deer and wild boar, 
                        but they can also hunt smaller animals when necessary. Their powerful jaws and sharp claws make them formidable predators.</p>
                    <p>
                        Tigers are known for their territorial behavior, marking their territory with scent markings and vocalizations. 
                        They are also excellent swimmers and often hunt in water, using their stealth to ambush prey.</p>
                    <p>
                        Tigers are classified as endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. 
                        Conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and increase their populations in the wild.</p>
                    <p>
