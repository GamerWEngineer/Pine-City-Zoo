                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Koalas are tree-dwelling marsupials native to Australia. They are known for their distinctive appearance, 
                        with large ears, a stout body, and a flat nose. Koalas primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves and are known for 
                        their sedentary lifestyle, spending most of their time sleeping in trees.</p>
                    <p>
                        Koalas are herbivores, with a diet consisting almost entirely of eucalyptus leaves. 
                        They have a specialized digestive system that allows them to detoxify the chemicals in these leaves. 
                        Koalas are mostly nocturnal and are known for their unique vocalizations, which can be heard during mating season.</p>
                    <p>
                        Koalas are marsupials, meaning they carry their young in a pouch. 
                        The young, called joeys, are born very small and continue to develop in the mother's pouch for several months. 
                        After leaving the pouch, joeys will continue to nurse and stay with their mothers for up to a year.</p>
                    <p>
                        Koalas are found in the eucalyptus forests of eastern and southeastern Australia. 
                        They play a crucial role in their ecosystem by helping to maintain the health of eucalyptus trees. 
                        However, they are currently listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss, disease, and climate change.</p>
