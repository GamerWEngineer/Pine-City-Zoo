                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Giraffes are the world's tallest land animals, known for their long necks and legs. 
                        They can reach heights of up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) and have a unique spotted coat that helps them blend into their savanna habitat. 
                        Giraffes primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers from tall trees, using their long tongues to grasp food.</p>
                    <p>These gentle giants are social animals, often found in loose herds.
                        Giraffes have a unique way of walking, moving both legs on one side of their body and then the other, which gives them a distinctive gait. 
                        Their long necks allow them to reach high branches for food, but they also use them in combat, swinging their necks to strike opponents during fights.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are herbivores and can consume up to 75 pounds (34 kg) of leaves and twigs each day.
                        They have a specialized digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from tough plant material. 
                        Giraffes are also known for their unique social structure.
                        They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including grunts, snorts, and hisses, and they can also use body language to convey messages.</p>
                    <p>Sadly, giraffes face threats from habitat loss and poaching for their skins and bones.
                        Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures and their habitats.
                        Giraffes play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping to maintain the balance of vegetation and providing food for other animals.</p>
