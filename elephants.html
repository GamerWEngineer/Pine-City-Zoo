                    <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They are known for their intelligence, strong social bonds, and long memories. 
                        Elephants have a unique trunk that serves multiple purposes, including feeding, drinking, and social interaction. 
                        They are herbivores and can consume up to 300 pounds of food in a single day.</p>
                    <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long
                        trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting
                        water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve 
                        as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear 
                        flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry 
                        their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while 
                        Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
                    <p>Elephants are found in various habitats, including savannas, forests, and grasslands. 
                        They play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping to maintain the balance of vegetation and creating water holes that 
                        benefit other wildlife.</p>
                    <p>Sadly, elephants face threats from habitat loss and poaching for their ivory tusks. 
                        Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures and their habitats.</p>
