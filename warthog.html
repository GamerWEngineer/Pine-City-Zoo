                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Warthogs are wild pigs native to Africa, known for their distinctive tusks and facial warts. 
                        They inhabit savannas, grasslands, and woodlands, often found near water sources.</p>
                    <p>
                        Warthogs are omnivorous, primarily feeding on grasses, roots, fruits, and occasionally small animals. 
                        Their tusks are used for digging and defense against predators.</p>
                    <p>
                        Warthogs are social animals, often seen in small groups called sounders, which consist of females and their young. 
                        Males are usually solitary or form bachelor groups. They are known for their habit of kneeling on their front knees while grazing.</p>
                    <p>
                        Warthogs have a unique defense mechanism; when threatened, they often run into their burrows headfirst, using their tusks to protect themselves. 
                        They are also known for their ability to run quickly, reaching speeds of up to 30 miles per hour.</p>
                    <p>
                        Warthogs play a crucial role in their ecosystem by helping to aerate the soil and control vegetation growth. 
                        They are also preyed upon by large carnivores such as lions and hyenas.</p>
