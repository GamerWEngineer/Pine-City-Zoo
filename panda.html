                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Pandas are large, bear-like mammals known for their distinctive black and white fur. 
                        They are native to the mountainous regions of central China and primarily feed on bamboo.</p>
                    <p>
                        Pandas are classified as carnivores, but their diet consists almost entirely of bamboo, 
                        which makes up about 99% of their food intake. They have strong jaws and teeth adapted for crushing bamboo stalks.</p>
                    <p>
                        Pandas are solitary animals, spending most of their time alone except during mating season or when a mother is raising her cubs. 
                        They are known for their playful behavior and can often be seen climbing trees or rolling around in the grass.</p>
                    <p>
                        Pandas are considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and low birth rates. 
                        Conservation efforts are underway to protect their natural habitats and increase their population in the wild.</p>
                    <p>
