                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Monkeys are highly intelligent and social animals, known for their playful behavior 
                        and complex social structures. They belong to the primate order and are found in various 
                        habitats around the world, primarily in tropical rainforests.</p>
                    <p>
                        Monkeys are divided into two main groups: New World monkeys, which are found in the Americas, 
                        and Old World monkeys, which inhabit Africa and Asia. They have a wide range of diets, including 
                        fruits, leaves, insects, and small animals. Their social structures can vary from small family 
                        groups to large troops, and they communicate through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Monkeys are known for their dexterity and intelligence, often using tools to obtain food or solve problems. 
                        They play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping to disperse seeds and maintain the health of their habitats.
                    </p>
                    <p>Monkeys are also popular in human culture, often featured in literature, films, and as pets. However, many species 
                        face threats from habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal pet trade, leading to conservation efforts to protect them.
